                <p>I’m from Great Falls, Montana. I’m currently attending the University of Montana, where I’m majoring in Media Arts and earning certificates in Web Design and Graphic Design. I’ve always loved art and creativity, and my goal is to become a professional graphic designer. I also hope to sell my artwork on the side.
When I’m not designing, I love spending time with my friends and family—they’re a big source of inspiration and support in my life. </p>

                    <p>I have two siblings one is my twin sister and the other is my big brother. I remeber always playing video games with them when we were yonger. My favorite was Super Monkey Ball on the gamecube. With the same setup and game I decided to revisit it with a few of my friends and it was a blast and I couldn't believe how hard it was because as a kid it didn't feel as hard. Yeah that was a fun memory. </p>
